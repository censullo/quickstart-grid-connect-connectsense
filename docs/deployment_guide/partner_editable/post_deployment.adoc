//Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

=== Retrieve the API Gateway URL and API key

. Open the AWS CloudFormation console, and choose your deployed stack. 
. Retrieve the API Gateway URL.
.. Choose the *Outputs* tab.
.. Copy the value of the *ApiGatewayURL* key, and save the value for use in configuring your {partner-product-short-name}.
. Retrieve the API key's physical ID.
.. Choose the *Resources* tab.
.. In the *Logical ID* column, find *ApiKey*, and choose its *Physical ID* link. For example, see the circled link in <<api-key-id>>.

+
.. Next to *API key*, choose *Show*, as shown in <<api-key>>. This reveals the ID value required for registering your physical device. Save this value for use in configuring your {partner-product-short-name}.

=== Configure the {partner-product-short-name} with your new IoT endpoint

To configure your {partner-product-short-name}, you need the Python script that's maintained and hosted by ConnectSense in their GitHub repository. 

. Download the https://github.com/connectsense/quickstart-devkit-device-connection[ConnectSense Device Connection repository^], and retrieve the script. 
. Follow the configuration steps in the repository. You need the API Gateway URL and the API key that you retrieved earlier. (See link:#_retrieve_the_api_gateway_url_and_api_key[Retrieve the API Gateway URL and API key], previously in this guide.)
