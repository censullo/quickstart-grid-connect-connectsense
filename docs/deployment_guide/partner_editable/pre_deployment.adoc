== Pre deployment steps


=== Prepare for the deployment

To provision the {partner-product-short-name}, you need the following:

* A load or test device, such as a fan or light bulb, plugged into the {partner-product-short-name}. 
* An AWS account. If you don't have an AWS account, you can create one at https://aws.amazon.com[https://aws.amazon.com^].
* A user with permission to launch AWS CloudFormation stacks that create IAM roles.
