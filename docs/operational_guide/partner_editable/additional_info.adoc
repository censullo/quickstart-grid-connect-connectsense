== Create an Amazon QuickSight dashboard

You can use Amazon QuickSight to create a dashboard to visualize the metrics from the connected {partner-product-short-name}. Follow these steps to set up a dashboard for visualizing the watts used by the connected {partner-product-short-name} over time.

.    	From the AWS Management Console, open the QuickSight console.
.    	Choose *New Analysis*, *New Dataset*, *AWS IoT Analytics*.
.    	Choose the AWS IoT Analytics dataset that was created by your stack named `ConnectSenseQuickstartDataset`.
.    	Choose *Create data source*, *Visualize*.
.    	In the *Visual types* panel, choose *Line Chart*.
.    	Choose *Field wells* at the top to expand the panel of field wells, as shown in <<field-wells>>.

. From the *Fields list*, drag the *datetime* label into the *X axis* field well. Choose the down arrow next to `datetime (MINUTE)`, and for aggregate, choose *minute*.
. From the *Fields list*, drag the *watts* label into the *Value* field well. Choose the down arrow next to `watts (Median)`, and for aggregate, choose *average*.
.	From the *Fields list*, drag the *thing_name* label into the *Color* field well.

Your field wells now look something like <<field-wells-units>>.

You now see the watts plotted something like <<quicksight-data-viz>>:
