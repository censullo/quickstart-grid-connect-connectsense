You can use this Quick Start with the {partner-product-short-name}, shown in <<spc>>, to connect your legacy edge devices and machines—such as motors, pumps, compressors, electric cars, or IT equipment—with an IoT architecture on AWS. You can ingest power-related metrics from any 110-VAC or 240-VAC device into AWS IoT Core.

This Quick Start works with a model of the {partner-product-short-name} that's designed for AWS. Here are some examples of things you might do remotely with this deployment: 
|===

| Monitor power. | Turn power on or off. | Reboot. 
| Sense usage. | Get a calculated value for the watt-hours. | Power cycle a load on or off. 
| Read voltage. | Read current in amps. | Read the power factor. 
| Provide data that leads to better maintenance schedules. | Monitor and control pumps, commercial appliances, and electric-vehicle chargers. | Reduce electricity consumption by switching off the power supply to groups of customers (load shedding) when the entire system is at risk. 
|===

The {partner-product-short-name} uses a Secure Element authentication chip that's preloaded with credentials to help you provision your cloud application securely.

The Quick Start uses several AWS services that give you a way to test your {partner-product-short-name} against a realistic backend application. You can augment the Quick Start with additional services and features to create a full-fledged, production-grade application.
