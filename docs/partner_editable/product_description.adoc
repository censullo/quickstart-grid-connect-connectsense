This Quick Start works with the https://www.gridconnect.com/products/smart-power-cord-aws[{partner-product-name} for AWS^] (CS-SC-EXT6-15AMP-AWS) distributed by Grid Connect. You can use this Quick Start with the {partner-product-short-name}, shown in <<spc>>, to connect your legacy edge devices and machines—such as motors, pumps, compressors, electric cars, and IT equipment—to an IoT architecture on AWS. AWS IoT Core can ingest power-related metrics from any 110 V or 240 V device.

The following are some examples of things you might do remotely with this deployment: 
|===

| Monitor power. | Turn power on or off. | Reboot. 
| Sense usage. | Get a calculated value for the watt-hours. | Power cycle a load on or off. 
| Read voltage. | Read current in amps. | Read the power factor. 
| Provide data that leads to better maintenance schedules. | Monitor and control pumps, commercial appliances, and electric-vehicle chargers. | Reduce electricity consumption by switching off the power supply to groups of customers (load shedding) when the entire system is at risk. 
|===

The {partner-product-short-name} uses a Secure Element authentication chip that's preloaded with credentials to help you provision your cloud application securely. You can augment the Quick Start with additional services and features to create a full-fledged, production-grade application.
