As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* Amazon API Gateway for ConnectSense devices to self-provision.
* AWS Lambda: one function to provision devices and one to generate alerts sent to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. The Lambda functions require Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.
* An Amazon SNS topic for publishing alerts.
* AWS IoT Analytics pipeline, channel, data store, and dataset for data processing.
* An Amazon Quicksight dashboard for data visualization.

//TODO Dylan is revising this list when we get feedback on the revised architecture diagram.
