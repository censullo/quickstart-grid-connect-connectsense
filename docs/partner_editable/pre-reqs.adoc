==== Prepare for the deployment

To provision the SPC DevKit, you will need:

* The ConnectSense SPC DevKit will need to have a load or test device plugged in like a fan or light bulb. 
* An AWS account. If you donâ€™t have an AWS account, you may create one at https://aws.amazon.com[https://aws.amazon.com].
* A user with permissions to launch AWS CloudFormation stacks that create IAM roles.
