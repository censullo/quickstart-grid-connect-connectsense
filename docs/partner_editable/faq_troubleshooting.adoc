[red]*Q.* I encountered a CREATE_FAILED error when I launched the Quick Start. +
[red]*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page). With this setting, the stack’s state will be retained and the instance will be left running so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in  `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService+ and +C:\cfn\log+`).

IMPORTANT:   When you set *Rollback on failure* to *No*, you will continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation] on the AWS website.

[red]*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates. +
[red]*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a non-S3 location, you might encounter template size limitations when you create the stack. For more information about AWS CloudFormation limits, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation].
